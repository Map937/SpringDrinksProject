# SpringDrinksProject

Why are we doing this? 

This project focuses on creating the backend of an app for drinks. We will implement CRUD functionality so that anyone wishing to create, read, update or delete drinks from the drink table is able to do so. From this project we will learn about the basic necessities and functions of an app so we can understand how to work on apps in the future.

How I expected the challenge to go. 

I believe creating the app in the time given will be fine considering we have had practice going over a similar app. However, trying to recall all the different code that goes into the app will be challenging as well as having to do all the extras at the same time (remembering to push changes, update project management, creating documentation etc.). Also there may be some issues with running tests for Read, Update and Delete as we have not covered these tests yet.

What went well? / What didn't go as planned? 

The project generally went as planned, I could recall most of the steps to take however, I needed to remind myself of how to write the code exactly. The part I struggled on most was the testing which took me a lot longer than expected as I was not very familiar with testing. However, I did understand the code a lot more after going through creating the methods. Keeping Jira and Git up to date also slowed my progress.

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project. 

If I were to do the project again I would have added more methods for interacting with the app, such as find by name or delete all.
