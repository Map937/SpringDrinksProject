# SpringDrinksProject

Why are we doing this? 

This project focuses on creating the backend of an app for drinks. We will implement CRUD functionality so that anyone wishing to create, read, update or delete drinks from the drink table is able to do so. From this project will learn about the basic neccessities of an app so we can understand work on apps in the future.

How I expected the challenge to go. 

I believe creating the app in the time given will be fine considering we have had practice going over a similar app. However, trying to recall all the different code that goes into the app will be challenging as well as having to do all the extras at the same time (remembering to push changes, update project management, creating documentation etc.). Also there may be some issues with running tests for Read, Update and Delete as we have not covered these tests yet.
